Hilo game team activity for CSE 210

How to play:
- A card will be drawn with a value from 1 to 13.
- Guess whether the next card drawn will be higher or lower than the first card.
- A correct guess nets +100 points.
- An incorrect guess nets -75 points.
- If the new card is equal to the first card, it's game over.

Game ends when points reach zero, if the player busts, or when the player cashes out.
